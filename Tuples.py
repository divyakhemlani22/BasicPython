# Tuples - Storing multiple pieces of information
coordinates = (4,5)
# Immutable -> Cannot change, erase, modify the tuple
print(coordinates[0])

# Difference between tuples and lists
# Lists -> Can assign values, mutate, add, delete, modify, change
# Tuples -> Use for data that will never change or cannot mutate (e.g. coordinates)
